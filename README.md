# End-To-End-ETL-Pipeline-Using-Airflow-And-Astro

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline for weather data using Apache Airflow, managed and orchestrated with Astro (Astronomer CLI). The pipeline extracts current weather information from the Open-Meteo API, transforms it into a structured format, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database.

#Apache Airflow
Apache Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows you to define workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of tasks. Airflow is widely used for orchestrating complex data pipelines, automating batch jobs, and managing ETL processes.

#Astro
Astro (Astronomer CLI) is a command-line interface tool that simplifies the development, deployment, and management of Apache Airflow projects. It provides a local development environment (using Docker) that mirrors a production Airflow environment, making it easy to test and iterate on your DAGs.
